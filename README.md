# hits-algorithm
this jupyter notebook implements the hits algorithm as described on [http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Winter2009/RalucaRemus/Lecture4/lecture4.html]( http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Winter2009/RalucaRemus/Lecture4/lecture4.html)
It uses the example from [Here](http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs246-2012/slides/10-hits.pdf) at slide 48.
The code to take the adjacency matrix as input has been commented out in favour of demonstrating the example provided at the specified website
